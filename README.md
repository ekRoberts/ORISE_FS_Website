# Emma Roberts ORISE Project

This project is in conjection with Dr. Steve Leavitt at BYU and The Lichen Air Quality division of the Forest Service. Stored within the GitHub are the files for the updated Lichen Air Quailty Clearinghouse and a shiny app that provides query and mapping tools for the current US National Lichen Data.
