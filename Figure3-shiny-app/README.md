# Figure3-shiny-app

This app is a plotting tool where users can select from three forest service databases and choose from selected plot outputs to visualize current data.

The Lichen database is where all of the lichen samples are categorized and named for each of the plots.

The Plot database provides more information about the location and environment of each of the lichen plots. 

The Elemental database has information about the trace elements found in the sampled lichen.

This app is currently deployed and embedded within this website: https://dev.dsiemqxdujil1.amplifyapp.com/.
